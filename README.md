# ESP32 GPIO Control and Scheduling Web Server

This project implements a web server on an ESP32 microcontroller to remotely manage GPIO pins and their schedules. The web interface allows users to toggle GPIO states, set schedules, and manage network connections. The configuration is stored in SPIFFS, ensuring persistence across reboots.

## Features

- **WiFi Connectivity**: Connects to a specified WiFi network and allows network management via the web interface.
- **Web Server**: Hosts a web server on port 80 to handle various HTTP requests.
- **GPIO Management**: Supports up to 10 GPIO pins, allowing users to toggle states and configure pin numbers via the web interface.
- **Scheduling**: Provides a scheduling feature to automatically control GPIO states based on specified start and end times.
- **Time Synchronization**: Synchronizes time using NTP servers and allows setting of GMT offset.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Displays real-time updates of system time, uptime, and CPU load on the web interface.
- **Network Scanning and Connection**: Scans for available WiFi networks and allows users to connect to a selected network.
- **Persistent Configuration**: Saves and loads configuration data to/from SPIFFS, ensuring persistence across reboots.
- **SPIFFS Formatting**: Provides an option to format SPIFFS through the web interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- ESP32 microcontroller
- Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support installed
- WiFi network credentials

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/taloot/esp32-gpio-control.git
   cd esp32-gpio-control
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:
   Open the `esp32-gpio-control.ino` file in Arduino IDE.

3. **Configure WiFi Credentials**:
   Update the WiFi SSID and password in the `setup` function:
   ```cpp
   char ssid[32] = "your_SSID";
   char pass[64] = "your_PASSWORD";
   ```

4. **Install ESP32 Board Support**:
   - Open Arduino IDE.
   - Go to `File` -> `Preferences`.
   - In the `Additional Board Manager URLs` field, add the following URL:
     ```
     https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
     ```
   - Go to `Tools` -> `Board` -> `Boards Manager`.
   - Search for `ESP32` and install the `esp32` package by Espressif Systems.

5. **Select the ESP32 Board**:
   - Go to `Tools` -> `Board` and select your ESP32 board model (e.g., `ESP32 Dev Module`).

6. **Select the Port**:
   - Connect your ESP32 to your computer via USB.
   - Go to `Tools` -> `Port` and select the appropriate COM port for your ESP32.

7. **Upload the Code**:
   - Click the `Upload` button in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the code to your ESP32.

### Usage

1. **Access the Web Interface**:
   - After uploading, open the Serial Monitor (set baud rate to 115200) to find the IP address assigned to the ESP32.
   - Open this IP address in a web browser.

2. **GPIO Control**:
   - Toggle GPIO states by clicking the "Toggle" button.
   - Set GPIO pin numbers using the form provided.
   - Add or remove GPIO pins as needed.

3. **Set Schedules**:
   - Configure start and end times for each GPIO pin to automate control.

4. **Time and Status Updates**:
   - The web interface displays real-time system time, uptime, and CPU load.
   - GMT offset can be adjusted using the provided form.

5. **Network Management**:
   - Scan for available networks and connect to a selected network using the web interface.

6. **SPIFFS Management**:
   - Format SPIFFS using the provided button.

### Application Scenario

This ESP32 GPIO control and scheduling web server can be used in various practical scenarios, such as:

#### Home Automation
- **Lighting Control**: Automate home lighting by scheduling GPIO pins to turn lights on/off at specific times.
- **Appliance Management**: Control and schedule appliances like fans, heaters, or coffee makers to operate at desired times.

#### Agriculture
- **Irrigation Systems**: Schedule water pumps to irrigate crops at specific intervals, optimizing water usage.
- **Greenhouse Management**: Control ventilation and heating systems in a greenhouse to maintain optimal conditions for plant growth.

#### Industrial Automation
- **Machine Scheduling**: Automate factory machinery to run at scheduled times, improving efficiency and reducing manual intervention.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Control exhaust fans and air quality monitoring systems based on scheduled times or sensor inputs.

#### Office Spaces
- **Energy Management**: Schedule office lighting and HVAC systems to operate during working hours, reducing energy consumption during off-hours.
- **Access Control**: Automate door locks or access gates to ensure they are secured outside of working hours.
